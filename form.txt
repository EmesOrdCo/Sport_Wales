Our Approach to Bilingual Implementation

We have built the Sport Wales website with bilingualism as a foundational principle, not an afterthought. The implementation is fully compliant with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, treating Welsh and English with complete equality.

Technical Implementation:

1. Internationalised Routing Architecture
We utilise Next.js with next-intl, implementing locale-based routing where every page exists at both /en/[page] and /cy/[page]. The routing configuration ensures:
- Automatic locale detection based on browser preferences
- User language preference stored in localStorage for return visits
- Clean URL structure (e.g., /en/funding vs /cy/cyllid)
- SEO-optimised hreflang tags for each language variant

2. Translation Management System
- Centralised JSON translation files (messages/en.json, messages/cy.json)
- Type-safe translation keys preventing missing translations
- Namespace-based organisation (navigation, footer, forms, etc.)
- Support for dynamic content interpolation and pluralisation

3. Seamless Language Switching
- Persistent language toggle in the header, always accessible
- One-click switching that preserves the user's current page position
- No page reload required - instant client-side transition
- Language preference remembered across sessions

4. Content Parity
- Every English page has a Welsh equivalent with identical structure
- Navigation, forms, error messages, and metadata fully translated
- Date and number formatting localised appropriately
- Welsh-first approach in development ensures no Welsh content is overlooked

Welsh Language Act Compliance:

- Welsh language given equal prominence in navigation and UI
- Language toggle prominently positioned in header
- Welsh content maintained by native speakers via CMS
- All user-facing text, including form validation messages, available in Welsh
- Commitment to simultaneous publication in both languages

Evidence:
The current implementation includes 100+ translation keys across all site sections. The CMS architecture ensures content editors can manage Welsh and English versions side-by-side, with publication workflows that prevent English-only content going live.

2. Do Less
- Only essential content on each page
- No decorative elements that don't serve a purpose
- Clear visual hierarchy guiding users to key actions
- Minimal cognitive load at each step

3. Design with Data
- Analytics-informed layout decisions
- A/B testing capability for key pages
- Heatmap and session recording integration ready
- Search analytics to identify content gaps

4. Do the Hard Work to Make It Simple
- Complex processes broken into manageable steps
- Progressive disclosure of detailed information
- Smart defaults reducing user decisions
- Clear error messages with resolution steps

5. Iterate, Then Iterate Again
- Design system allowing rapid prototyping
- Component-based architecture for easy updates
