- Set up appropriate redirects or archives

### 2. Quality Assurance
- ✅ All detailed content has been transferred
- Verify all links work correctly

- Validate all statistics and quotes are accurate

### 3. SEO & Redirects
- Set up 301 redirects for all mapped pages
- Update XML sitemap with all new pages

- Check canonical URLs

### 4. Testing
- Test all page routes (English and Welsh)

## Notes

1. **Language Routing**: All new pages use language prefixes (`/en/` and `/cy/`) as defined in `src/i18n/routing.ts`

2. **Content Consolidation**: Some old pages were intentionally consolidated:
   - 3 vision/strategy pages → 1 `/about/vision-and-strategy` page
   - 2 national centre pages → 1 `/national-centre` page
   - Multiple CLIP subpages → `/clip` main page

3. **Content Integration**: Detailed content from old pages was integrated into logical parent pages rather than creating separate pages, maintaining better site structure.

4. **Historical Content**: Some old pages (campaigns, historical surveys) may be archived rather than migrated to keep the new site focused on current content.

5. **Form Pages**: Form submission confirmation pages are handled within the form submission flow rather than as separate pages.
